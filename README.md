# VRBadminton
The main function of this project is for solo badminton practice. After wearing CardBoard glasses, the player can see a 3D badminton site. Opposite the player is a pitching machine that emits a shuttlecock at regular intervals; Players can change the viewing Angle by turning their head and moving their body, and they can also hit the badminton by waving their arms, so as to get the virtual experience of playing badminton.

This project can be decomposed into the following parts: 3D scene construction, Realsense information loading, human key point recognition, motion information binding, and perspective movement.
